  <p>Firefighters put out heavy fire in open porches by <strong>wetting the burning fuel surfaces</strong>—painting them with water.&nbsp; Since nearly all of those surfaces are easy to paint, these fuel-controlled fires do not need big GPM—even with big flames.</p>

 <p>What porch fires do need is speed.&nbsp; Threats to people, exposures, and the structure are best met by a <strong>fast exterior attack</strong>.&nbsp; Choose your default line for speed and mobility, but also consider how good it will be when working among vehicles, fences, junk etc.</p>
	
 
	
  <p>Don’t overthink things.&nbsp; Stacked porches are best hit from the lowest floor up, but plenty have been knocked from the top down.&nbsp; The best nozzle pattern is probably a narrow cone, but straight streams work fine.&nbsp; Attacking from the flank is often a good idea, but not critical.</p>

  <p>A sloppy knockdown in 15 seconds is much better than a textbook job that takes 60 seconds.&nbsp; Don’t run (physically or mentally), but act.</p>
	<p>Threats to outside FFs include fuel stored on the porch (gas can, propane tank etc), weakened porch structure, and the big distraction of big fire.&nbsp; Take advantage of distance and shielding opportunities.&nbsp; Stay off the damaged porches.&nbsp; Step back mentally and look around.</p>
	<p>When the exterior fire has been knocked down, take four seconds to wash the porch ceiling, soffit, or anywhere else the fire could enter a cockloft, trussloft, or attic.</p>

	<p>Top floor occupants are likely to be the most threatened.&nbsp; Top floor operations are likely to be the most risky.</p>
	
	<p>Doors and windows are an easy avenue of spread to the interior.&nbsp; Keep them intact if you can, but expect problems. </p>
	
	<p>Until the heavy fire is knocked down, be careful about venting elsewhere in the building.&nbsp; You don’t want to create a flow that sucks fire into the building.</p>
	
	<p>Interior floor joists next to an intense porch fire can suffer surprising amounts of damage.&nbsp; Don’t trust floors near the porches until you’ve checked them by opening the ceiling below.</p>
	
	<p>Assume that the cockloft or attic is involved—even if the thermal imager doesn't show it yet.</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>Get post-fire pix of the spot where the fire did or didn't enter the cockloft or attic.&nbsp; Use them in the review.</p>

<section class="RQs"><h2>Questions</h2>
	
	<h3>Why is it better to attack stacked porches from the bottom up?</h3>
	<p>When you wet high surfaces, any fire below them will work to dry them out and reignite them.&nbsp; When you wet low surfaces, they stay wet and you can work your way up.</p>
	
	<h3>How can we calculate the GPM required to knock down a porch fire?</h3>
	<p>I don’t know, and it might be a moot point.&nbsp; You’re flowing enough water if you can reach all the fuel surfaces and if each surface stays wet for a few seconds.&nbsp; You will almost certainly need more GPM to get the reach than you will need to knock the fire.</p>
	
	<h3>Are there any situations that require extra GPM?</h3>
	<p>Sort of.&nbsp; Asphalt shingles require more water than other common fuel surfaces.&nbsp; If a roof or other area seems stubborn, you can put more water on each square foot by slowing down your sweep speed.&nbsp; Be systematic about making progress across that surface.</p>
