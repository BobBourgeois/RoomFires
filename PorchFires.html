    Open Porch Fires etc
    
  </h1>
</header>	
  
  <p>Firefighters put out heavy fire in open porches by wetting fuel surfaces—painting them with water.  Since nearly all of those surfaces are easy to paint, these fuel-controlled fires do not need big GPM—even with big flames.</p>
  <p>What porch fires do need is speed.  Threats to people, exposures, and the structure are best met by a fast exterior attack.  Choose your default line for speed and mobility, but also consider how good it will be when working among vehicles, fences, junk etc.</p>
  <p>Don’t overthink things.  Stacked porches are best hit from the lowest floor up, but plenty have been knocked from the top down.   The best nozzle pattern is probably a narrow cone, but straight streams work fine.  Attacking from the flank is often a good idea, but not critical.</p>

  <p>A sloppy knockdown in 15 seconds is much better than a textbook job that takes 60 seconds.  Don’t run (physically or mentally), but act.</p>
	<p>Threats to outside FFs include fuel stored on the porch (gas can, propane tank etc), weakened porch structure, and the very big distraction of big fire.  Take advantage of distance and shielding opportunities.  Stay off the damaged porches.  Step back mentally and look around.</p>
	<p>When the exterior fire has been knocked down, take four seconds to wash the porch roof, soffit, or anywhere else the fire could enter a cockloft or attic.</p>

	<p>Top floor occupants are likely to be the most threatened. Top floor operations are likely to be the most risky.</p>
	
	<p>Windows are an easy avenue of spread to the interior.  Keep them intact if you can, but expect problems. </p>
	
	<p>Until the heavy fire is knocked down, be careful about venting elsewhere in the building.  You don’t want to create a flow path that sucks fire into the building.</p>
	
	<p>Interior floor joists next to an intense porch fire can suffer surprising amounts of damage.  Don’t trust floors near the porches until you’ve checked them by opening the ceiling below.</p>
	
	<p>Assume that the cockloft or attic is involved.</p>

	<h3>Why is it better to attack stacked porches from the bottom up?</h3>
	<p>When you wet high surfaces, any fire below them will work to dry them out and reignite them.  When you wet low surfaces, they stay wet and you can work your way up.</p>
	
	<h3>How can we calculate the GPM required to knock down a porch fire?</h3>
	<p>I don’t know, and it might be a moot point.  You’re flowing enough water if you can reach all the fuel surfaces and if each surface stays wet for a few seconds.  You will almost certainly need more GPM to get the reach than you will need to knock the fire.</p>
	
	<h3>Are there any situations that require more GPM?</h3>
	<p>Sort of.  Asphalt shingles require more water than other common fuel surfaces.  If a subroof or other area seems stubborn, you can put more water on each square foot by slowing down your sweep speed. Be systematic about making progress across that surface.</p>
