<p>What gpm should be used for interior attack at common residential fires?</p>
	
<p>The more-is-better argument is popular in the U.S. right now, but any bandwagon should welcome scrutiny.&nbsp; It’s okay to revisit any question.</p>
	
<p>Is 150 gpm better than 100?&nbsp; 185 better than 150?&nbsp;  Would 200 be better still?</p>
	
<p>  To see why <strong>all three answers are "no"</strong>, break the issue into two queries.&nbsp;  What minimum do you need?&nbsp;  How much extra do you want as a margin of safety?&nbsp; To tackle either question, we need to realize that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>There are multiple safety margins in play.</li>
	<li>The margins don’t have the same minimums (reference points.)</li>
	<li>Increases to a margin have diminishing value as the margin grows (i.e. increases have less value for margins that are already big.)</li>
	<li>There are always tradeoffs.&nbsp; Margin increases come at a price.</li>
	</ul>
	
<br>
	
	
<p>The main gpm safety margins are for <strong>knockdown</strong> and <strong>flow reduction</strong>.&nbsp; You want to be okay if knocking the fire somehow requires more water than expected.&nbsp; You also want to be okay if a kink or some other mishap reduces your flow.</p>
	
<p>The flow-reduction margin's reference point (RP-kink) is the smallest flow that will provide a usable stream.&nbsp; It’s the bottom of the nozzle’s operating range.</p>

<p>The knockdown margin's reference point is the smallest flow that will black the fire out.&nbsp; Any flow less than RP-Knockdown will fail to kill the fire.&nbsp; Any flow more than RP-Knockdown will give you a margin of safety.&nbsp; The actual number varies from fire to fire, so for planning purposes we take 30 gpm as an adequate residential RP-Knockdown.&nbsp; It would easily cope with all but the largest residential rooms.</p>	

<p>As with most safety margins, distance above the reference point will limit the benefit of a margin increase.&nbsp; If your RP is 30, a flow increase from 40 to 60 would have more value than a boost from 140 to 160.&nbsp; It’s unlikely that the higher numbers would ever come into play.</p>

	<figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig.1&nbsp;  GPM safety margin examples</figcaption>
</figure>
	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows that, when some departments pushed residential target flows from 100 gpm to 150, they expanded knockdown margins that were already large.&nbsp; Any risk reduction was tiny.&nbsp; Kink margins shrank if they changed from adjustable-flow to fixed-flow nozzles (e.g. automatic to smooth-bore); grew if they kept adjustable-flow; and stayed the same if they kept fixed-flow.&nbsp; So the only benefit of the flow increase went to departments that had adjustable flow nozzles and stayed with them.&nbsp;  They saw a decline of their already low risk from kinks.</p>	
	
<br>
	
<p>Comparing benefits to costs, we see several tradeoffs.&nbsp; Two stand out.</p>	
<ul>
	<li>Applying more water requires more exertion.</li>
	<li>Applying more water requires more water.</li>
	</ul>	

<p>More exertion should trigger questions about cardiac events, about using your air supply faster, reduced work time, and possibly exhaustion.&nbsp; Using more water can of course cause you to run out of water, but the fear of running out of water can also have a ripple effect on other decisions and cost you time. </p>

<p>You're safer and more effective if you take a disciplined approach to exertion efficiency and water efficiency. </p>	
	
<p>But don't stop there.&nbsp; Study more tradeoffs:&nbsp; maneuverability, stream-reach, adaptivity, false sense of security, misdirection of training, water damage.&nbsp; See the whole board.&nbsp; Think beyond room knockdown—it's often the easy part.&nbsp; </p>
	
<p>Remember that the tradeoffs are real and the bandwagon should spark skepticism:</p>	
	
<ul><p>Be skeptical of recommendations that add difficulty or complexity to an operation.</p>

<p>Be skeptical of the combat metaphor.&nbsp; Talking about “meeting the fire with overwhelming force” is not a substitute for thinking about how to put the fire out.</p>	
	
<p>Be skeptical of anxiety-based language.&nbsp; A nozzle team is unlikely to ever need or benefit from “every drop of water that you can get.”</p>	
	
<p>Be skeptical of comparisons to the past.&nbsp; They’re often false.</p>
	
<p>Be skeptical of training prop videos.&nbsp; They’re selling something.</p>	
	
<p>Be skeptical of knee-jerk objectives.&nbsp; “Apply as much water as possible” is a hollow objective that betrays a fundamental lack of understanding.</p>	
	</ul>

<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>Safety margins are mostly invisible in case studies, even though nearly all bad results can be described as a margin going to zero.&nbsp; It's hard to reconstruct how much leeway there was at any point during an incident, and even the task of identifying margins is probably foreign to most reviewers.</p>
	
	<p>But there is value in the process.&nbsp; Get in the habit of using the safety margin perspective as one view of every case.&nbsp; Study the tradeoffs.&nbsp; It’s a good way to learn about protective actions.</p>

	<h3>The RP of 30 gpm is a lot lower than some published calculations of required flow.&nbsp; Why the discrepancy?</h3>
	
		<p>Published numbers have been creeping up for decades.&nbsp; Anxiety played a role, but bad science and carelessness added to it.</p>

		<p>Some authors assumed that nozzle teams extinguish fire by absorbing all the heat being released (
			<span class = "tooltip">HRR<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat Release Rate</span></span></span>	
		).&nbsp; 
			<span class = "tooltip">Not true.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Fires are killed mostly by wetting the burning fuels—choking off the supply of pyrolysis gases.&nbsp; <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a></span></span></span>
		</p>

		<p>Some authors assumed that todays fires need more water than those that were studied in the past.&nbsp; 
			<span class = "tooltip">Not true.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >See <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a></span></span></span>
		</p>

		<p>Some authors treated target flows as required flows.&nbsp;  A common example is adding safety margins to NFPA’s 100 gpm target flow.&nbsp; Not needed since generous margins were already built in. </p>

		<p>Some field experience can be misleading when mental models are flawed.&nbsp; Nozzle teams who fail because they can't hit the burning fuels sometimes <span class = "tooltip">misread the problem
			<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Cockloft fires provide a common example.&nbsp; See <a href="FlameLength.html">Flame Length Etc</a> and <a href="Cocklofts.html">Cockloft Fires etc</a></span></span></span> 
		as not enough water.</p>
	
	<h3>Is added exertion really a problem?  Many departments are flowing the bigger numbers and seem to be doing okay.</h3>

		<p>If exertion were the only issue, it would be unimportant at most fires.&nbsp;  Most fires are easy and quick, and most FFs are not close to a cardiac event when they open the nozzle.</p>

		<p>But flowing wastefully has other costs; and a small percentage of fires can make you pay dearly for a lack of discipline.</p>
	
		<p>We should balance all the costs against <strong>the lack of any benefit</strong> from the bigger gpm numbers.</p>
	
			
	<h3>Can a safety margin analysis be applied to cooling on approach (COA)?</h3>
	
		<p>Yes and no.&nbsp; Trying to identify margins and tradeoffs is worthwhile but reference points are tough to pin down.&nbsp; It's not just that the physics and chemistry are hard (most real world situations are complex and their variety is staggering.)&nbsp; For many fires COA will likely do more harm than good; and when it might help, it’s value as a protective measure also depends on which other protective measures are available.</p>
	
		<p>The relevant threats are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>heat transfer to FFs</li>
			<li>flame propagation through airborne fuel</li>
			<li>flame spread over combustible surfaces</li>
			<li>flame extension (i.e. flame becomes longer without propagating through additional fuel).</li>
		</ul>


		<p>Each of these could have a margin in some fires but a lot of work needs to be done before we could know reference points—or even when the tactic will hurt or help.</p>

		<p>When looking at tradeoffs don’t forget perception.&nbsp; Once you open the nozzle you become visually impaired and hearing impaired.</p>

		<p>Study the whole board and be skeptical of the bandwagon.</p>
