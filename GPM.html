<p>How much water should firefighters be flowing through a hose making an interior attack against common residential fires?</p>
	
<p>The more-is-better argument is popular in the U.S. right now, but any bandwagon should welcome scrutiny.&nbsp; It’s okay to revisit any question.&nbsp; </p>
	
<p>  Is 150 gpm better than 100?&nbsp; 185 better than 150?&nbsp;  Would 200 be better still?&nbsp; To see why <strong>all three answers are "no"</strong>, break the issue into two queries.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>What minimums do you need?</li>
		<li>How much extra do you want as a margin of safety?</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>To tackle either question, we need to realize that:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>There are multiple safety margins in play.</li>
	<li>The margins don’t have the same minimums (reference points).</li>
	<li>Increases to a margin have diminishing value as the margin grows (i.e. increases have less value for margins that are already big).</li>
	<li>There are always tradeoffs.&nbsp; Margin increases come at a price.</li>
	</ul>
	
<br>
<p>The main gpm safety margins are for <strong>knockdown</strong> and <strong>flow reduction</strong>.&nbsp; You want to be okay if knocking the fire somehow requires more water than expected.&nbsp; You also want to be okay if a kink or some other mishap reduces flow to the nozzle.</p>
	
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:9%;margin-top:.1em;margin-right:1.5em; width:24%;float:left;"><img src="images/Kink.png"  alt="Flow from a firefighting nozzle is not enough to form a useable stream because of a kink in the hose" style="width:100%;float:left;"/><figcaption style="font-size:.8em;">Fig. 6-2&nbsp;  Kinks ruin your stream</figcaption></figure></p>		
	
<p>The reference point for the flow-reduction margin (RP-kink) is the bottom of the nozzle’s 
			<span class = "tooltip">operating range.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >A nozzle's operating range is the range of flows that will produce a usable stream.&nbsp; Precise limits are arguable, but comparisons are valid.</span></span></span>
    &nbsp;It’s the smallest flow that will provide a 
			<span class = "tooltip">usable stream.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >A usable stream is one that has enough reach but not too much reaction force.</span></span></span>
	 
</p>

<p>The reference point for the knockdown margin is the smallest flow that will black the fire out.&nbsp; Any flow less than RP-Knockdown will fail to kill the fire.&nbsp; Any flow more than RP-Knockdown will give you a margin of safety.&nbsp; The actual number varies from fire to fire, so for planning purposes we take 30 gpm as an adequate residential RP-Knockdown.&nbsp; It would easily cope with all but the largest residential rooms.</p>
    
<p>Your planned safety margin in each case is the difference between the reference point and the target flow that you select.</p>    

<p>As with most safety margins, distance above the reference point will limit the benefit of any increase to the margin.&nbsp; If your RP is 30, a target flow increase from 40 to 60 could be valuable.&nbsp; A boost from 140 to 160 would not.&nbsp; It’s unlikely that the higher numbers would ever come into play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
	
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:20%;margin-top:.1em;margin-right:1.5em; width:60%;"><img src="images/GPMsafetyMargins.png"  alt="Graph of flow safety margins for automatic and smooth-bore firefighting nozzles at 100 and 150 gpm.

<p>Figure 6-3 shows that, when some departments pushed residential target flows from 100 gpm to 150, they expanded knockdown margins that were already large (over 230%).&nbsp; Any risk reduction was tiny.&nbsp; Kink margins got worse if they changed from adjustable-flow to fixed-flow nozzles (e.g. automatic to smooth-bore); got better if they kept adjustable-flow; and stayed the same if they kept fixed-flow.&nbsp; So marginal benefit from the flow increase went only to departments that had adjustable-flow nozzles and stayed with them.&nbsp;  They saw a modest decline of their risk from kinks.</p>

<p>Comparing benefits to costs, we see several tradeoffs, but two stand out:</p>	
<ul>
	<li>Applying more water requires more exertion.</li>
	<li>Applying more water requires more water.</li>
	</ul>	

<p>More exertion should trigger questions about cardiac events, about using your air supply faster, reduced work time, and possibly exhaustion.&nbsp; Using more water can of course cause you to run out of water, but the fear of running out of water can also have a ripple effect on other decisions and cost you time. </p>

<p>You're safer and more effective if you take a <strong>disciplined approach to exertion efficiency and water efficiency. </strong></p>	
	
<p>But don't stop there.&nbsp; Study more tradeoffs:&nbsp; maneuverability, stream reach, adaptivity, false sense of security, misdirection of training, water damage, water weight, etc.&nbsp; See the whole board.&nbsp; Think beyond room knockdown—it's often the easy part.&nbsp; </p>
    
   
	
<p>Remember that the tradeoffs are real and the bandwagon should spark skepticism:</p>	
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:4%;width:40%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/RowTHs.png"  alt="Modern rowhouse condominims whose exteriors show complicated architectural detail that masks interior layouts." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 6-5&nbsp;   How much water through each line for interior fire attack?</figcaption></figure></p> 	
<ul><p>Be skeptical of recommendations that add difficulty or complexity to an operation.</p>

<p>Be skeptical of the combat metaphor.&nbsp; Talking about “meeting the fire with overwhelming force” is not a substitute for thinking about how to put the fire out.</p>	
	
<p>Be skeptical of anxiety-based language.&nbsp; A nozzle team is unlikely to ever need or benefit from “every drop of water that you can get.”</p>	
	
<p>Be skeptical of comparisons to the past.&nbsp; They’re often false.</p>
	
<p>Be skeptical of training prop magic shows.&nbsp; Ask the 
			<span class = "tooltip">basic simulation questions<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >What exactly is being simulated?&nbsp;<br>How is this simulation different from the corresponding real-world situation?</span></span></span>
early and often.&nbsp; Be wary of vague answers.&nbsp; Be wary of a fast presentation.</p>	
	
<p>Be skeptical of knee-jerk objectives.&nbsp; “Apply as much water as possible” is a hollow objective that betrays a fundamental lack of understanding.</p>	
	</ul>

	<p>Safety margins are mostly invisible in case studies, even though nearly all bad results can be described as a margin going to zero.&nbsp; It's hard to reconstruct how much leeway there was at key points during an incident.&nbsp; Even the task of identifying margins is probably foreign to most reviewers.</p>
	
	<p>But the process has value.&nbsp; Try to use the safety margin perspective as one view of every case.&nbsp; Study the tradeoffs.&nbsp; It’s a good way to learn about protective actions.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
<p>    In case studies, be careful to differentiate "not enough gpm" from "not hitting the burning fuel surfaces", or "don't know because we don't have enough good evidence".</p>

	<h3>The RP of 30 gpm is a lot lower than some published calculations of required flow.&nbsp; Why the discrepancy?</h3>
	
		<p>Published numbers have been creeping up for decades.&nbsp; Anxiety played a role, but bad science and carelessness added to it.</p>

		<p>Some authors assumed that nozzle teams extinguish fire by absorbing the heat being released 
			<span class = "tooltip">(HRR)<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat Release Rate</span></span></span>	
		.&nbsp; 
			<span class = "tooltip">Not true.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Fires are killed mostly by wetting the burning fuels—choking off the supply of pyrolysis gases.&nbsp; <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a></span></span></span>
		</p>

		<p>Some authors assumed that todays fires need more water than those that were studied in the past.&nbsp; 
			<span class = "tooltip">Not true.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >See <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a></span></span></span>
		</p>

		<p>Some authors confused target flows with required flows.&nbsp;  A common example is adding safety margins to NFPA’s 100gpm target flow.&nbsp; Not needed since generous margins were already built in. </p>

		<p>And some field experiences can be misleading when mental models are flawed.&nbsp; Nozzle teams who fail to kill a fire because they can't hit the burning fuels sometimes <span class = "tooltip">misread the problem

		as not enough water.</p>
    

	
	<h3>Is added exertion really a problem?  Many departments are flowing the bigger numbers and seem to be doing okay.</h3>
    
    <p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:4%;width:40%;Margin-top:.1em;margin-right: 9%; Float:right"><img src="images/Lin.png"  alt="Large, single-family residential building" style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 6-7&nbsp;  How much water through each line for interior fire attack?</figcaption></figure></p>
    
		<p>If exertion were the only issue, it would be unimportant at most fires.&nbsp;  Most fires are easy and quick, and most FFs are not close to a cardiac event when they open the nozzle.</p>

		<p>But a small percentage of fires can make you pay dearly for a lack of discipline; and flowing wastefully has other costs.</p>
	
		<p>We should balance all the costs against <strong>the lack of any benefit</strong> from the bigger gpm numbers.</p>
	
			
	<h3>Can a safety margin analysis be applied to cooling on approach (COA)?</h3>
	
		<p>Yes and no.&nbsp; Trying to identify margins and tradeoffs is worthwhile, but reference points are tough to pin down.&nbsp; It's not just that the physics and chemistry are hard (most real world situations are complex and their variety is staggering.)&nbsp; For many fires, COA will likely do more harm than good; and when it might help, it’s value as a protective measure also depends on which other protective measures are available.</p>
	
		<p>The relevant threats to FFs are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>heat transfer to FFs (without flame)</li>
			<li>flame propagation through airborne fuel</li>
			<li>flame spread over combustible surfaces</li>
			<li>flame extension (i.e. flame becomes longer without propagating through additional fuel).</li>
		</ul>


		<p>Each of these could have a margin in some fires but a lot of work needs to be done before we could know reference points—or even when the tactic will hurt or help.</p>

		<p>(When looking at tradeoffs don’t forget perception.&nbsp; Once you open the nozzle you become visually impaired and hearing impaired.)</p>

		<p>Study the whole board and be skeptical of the bandwagon.</p>
