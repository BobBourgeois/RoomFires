# RoomFires
This is a project to craft good explanations of some basic concepts in firefighting.  It is focused on the language that we use.

Because we want language that can stand on its own, we exclude data representations, drawings, photographs, and video.  

Because we want language that helps people think clearly, we exclude a lot of commonly used jargon.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

For now, references are to firefighting in the United States.
