    Cockloft Fires etc
    
  </h1>
</header>
<p>Attacking a cockloft fire is mostly about wetting the burning fuel surfaces and ventilating intelligently.  It can be a tricky battle where the fire has several advantages.  Don’t underthink it.</p>
	
<p>Gut reaction for many FFs is to “get ahead” of the fire and put water on the farthest reach of flame.  But knockdown is not about hitting flame.  It’s about wetting the surfaces that are making fuel gases.  A long flame across the underside of a roof deck can extend over a big area that is not pyrolyzing yet.  Applying water here can push the flame around, but it is probably the most difficult and least effective way to kill the fire.</p>
	
<p>Try to determine where the burning surfaces are and paint them with water.  An important and often easy clue is to know where the fire came from—how it got into the cockloft.  An electrical fire in the top floor ceiling is very different from a fire coming up the walls or chases, and both are very different from an exterior fire that comes in through a soffit (porch fire etc).</p>

<p>If you do have a ceiling hole out ahead of the flame, you should be throwing water back toward the source of the fire.  The gold standard for cockloft attacks is a nozzle held above the joists.  The FF (keeping their head and body below the ceiling until the fire is controlled) directs the horizontal stream as needed and gets immediate feedback on the effect that it’s having.    Penetrating nozzles are also an option, as are combination nozzles using the sharp angle technique.  The key is to wet the surfaces actually burning and not just chase flame.</p>
		
<p>As with many fires, it’s best to control air supply until you can control the fire with water.  That means limit ceiling openings and choose their locations carefully.  Wind and the building’s cockloft vents can set limits, so be realistic when setting objectives.</p>	
	
<p>A roof hole can help by removing airborne fuel, and maybe turning a long horizontal flame into a vertical flame.  If it’s only the cockloft that needs to be vented, don’t push the ceiling down.  Let the interior crews continue to control the ceiling.  In addition to limiting the fire’s oxygen supply, they may be able to set up a helpful flow direction between a ceiling hole and the roof hole.</p>

<p>Check early for two ceilings and/or two roofs.</p>

	<p>The success of a cockloft attack may also depend on putting out fire that is coming up from below (porches, wall voids, chases etc).  It may be helpful to think of the two battles as separate tasks and make them separate assignments.  Physically separating the operations may also be possible if your ceiling hole for an above-the-joists cockloft attack is placed in an adjoing room.  </p>
	
	<p>When sizing up fire in walls and chases, don't forget about drop fire from melted tar and/or foamed plastic roofing products.</p>

	<h3>What effect does wind have?</h3>
	<p>As it does with other types of fires, wind can change ventilation options, change the way the fire spreads, and make size-up more difficult.  Expect sudden changes.  Don't force a ventilation option that isn't really available to you.  Don't be distracted by dancing flames.  Stay focused on identifying and wetting the burning fuel surfaces.  Nozzle-above-the-joists may be the only application method that will work if the wind is having a big effect.</p>
	
	<h3>What is needed for the nozzle-above-the-joists attack method?</h3>
	<p>Good interior ladder capabilities, and manageable kickback at the nozzle (i.e. sensible flow rate).</p>
	
	<h3>What flow rates are needed for cockloft fires?</h3>
	<p>It depends on the volume of fire and attack method chosen, but it's generally not a big water situation until the roof starts collapsing.  In the three-deckers that are common in the northeast, 50 GPM, hitting the right surfaces, is a lot of water.</p>
