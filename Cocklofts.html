<p>Killing a cockloft fire is about wetting the burning fuel surfaces and venting skillfully.&nbsp;  Don't stray from that mental model.</p>
	
<p>Gut reaction for many FFs is to “get ahead” of the fire and put water on its farthest reach.&nbsp; But <strong>control is not about working the leading edge.</strong></p>
<br>    
	
	         
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:9%;margin-top:.1em;margin-right:5.%; width:36%;float:left;"><img src="images/ApplyWater.png"  alt="Fire spreading across underside of roof deck, showing that water should be applied to burning fuels (seat of the fire), not the leading edge of flame." style ="width:100%;float:left;"/><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-2&nbsp;  Wet the pyrolyzing fuels, not the leading edge</figcaption></figure></p>
	
<p>Long flames spreading across the underside of a roof deck can extend over a big area that is not 
	<span class = "tooltip">pyrolyzing<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Pyrolysis is the generic term for the heat-driven processes that produce fuel gases from solid and liquid fuels.  These gases then fuel the flames.</span></span></span> 
yet.&nbsp; Applying water in that area can push the flame around, but it won't be an easy or effective way to kill the fire.</p>	


<p><strong>Control is about 
	  <span class = "tooltip">wetting the surfaces <span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Steam inerting and gas cooling can help, but stable progress in cocklofts almost always requires wetting the burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; See <a href="FlameLength.html">Flame Length etc</a> and <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a></span></span></span>	
	that are actively burning</strong> (i.e. already making the fuel gases that the flames need.)</p>
	
<p>Find those surfaces and paint them with water.&nbsp; Start by knowing where the fire came from—how it got into the cockloft.&nbsp; An electrical fire in the top floor ceiling is very different from a fire coming up inside the walls or 
    <span class = "tooltip">chases;<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Chases are building voids that contain plumbing or wiring.</span></span></span>    
 and both are very different from an exterior fire coming in through a soffit.</p>
	
<p>(Don't rely on just a thermal imager to track fire above the ceiling.&nbsp;  It takes time for the fire's heat to go through building materials to the ceiling or roof membrane where it's visible to the imager.&nbsp; The delay can throw your decisions off.)</p>	
    
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5%;width:36%;margin-right: 5.5%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/NozzleAboveJoist.png"  alt="Nozzle held above joists to apply water to burning fuels (seat of fire) in cockloft." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-3&nbsp;  Nozzle above joists</figcaption></figure></p>
    

<p>If you do have a ceiling hole out ahead of the flame, you should be throwing water back toward the source of the fire.&nbsp; The gold standard for cockloft attacks is a nozzle held above the joists.&nbsp; The FF (keeping their head and body below the ceiling until the fire is controlled) directs the horizontal stream and sees the effect that it’s having.</p>
	

	
	
<p>Penetrating nozzles are also an option, as are combination nozzles using the 
		<span class = "tooltip">sharp angle technique.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage"><img src="images/SharpAngle.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Sharp angle technique--Firefighting nozzle flowing a wide spray pattern is held in a void space and tilted so that some of its water is directed laterally toward the burning fuel surfaces.  Only a small fraction of its 360 degree pattern actually hits the fuels, but it can be enough to make stable progress."/></span></span></span>
	&nbsp; The key is to wet the surfaces that are actually burning and not just chase flame.</p>
	
<br/>
    

    
	
<p>Try to <strong>restrict the fire’s air supply</strong> by limiting ceiling holes until you’re ready to put water where it's needed.&nbsp; Wind and the building’s cockloft vents may work against you, so be realistic in your expectations.</p>	
    
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5%;width:36%;margin-right: 5.5%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/CLoftWhiteBrick.png"  alt="Cockloft on four-story apartment building." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-4&nbsp;  Cockloft with decorative cornice</figcaption></figure></p>	
    
<p>No easy rule governs roof ventilation.&nbsp;  Make your decision based on fire conditions, available protective measures, and likely benefits.&nbsp;  A roof hole can have some combination of <strong>four possible objectives:</strong></p> 
<ul>
	<li>draw the fire in a good direction;</li>
	<li>turn a horizontal flame into a vertical flame;</li>
	<li>remove airborne fuel			
		<span class = "tooltip">(AF)<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >In this context, airborne fuel includes pyrolosis gases and partially-burned fuels.&nbsp; See <a href="FlameLength.html#AFdef">Flame Length etc</a> for a more general discussion.</span></span></span>;</li>
	<li>improve conditions for the inside crews.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're sure that the cockloft is the only space that needs to be vented, consider letting the interior crews keep control of the ceiling—not pushing it down.&nbsp; They might want to limit the fire’s air supply; and they may be able to set up a helpful flow between a ceiling hole and the roof hole.</p>	

<p>Check early for two ceilings and/or two roofs.</p>

	<p>The success of a cockloft attack can also depend on putting out fire that is coming up from below (porches, wall voids, chases etc).&nbsp; It may be helpful to think of the two battles as separate jobs and make them separate assignments.&nbsp; Consider physically separating the jobs by using an above-the-joists cockloft attack from another room.</p>
	
	<p>When sizing up fire in walls and chases, don't forget about drop fire from melted roofing materials.</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>After the fire, get photos of the roof deck (from above and below) for the after-action review.  Also take shots of the fire's path into the cockloft and any building features that helped or hindered your efforts.</p>

<section class="RQs"><h2>Questions</h2>
	<h3>What about difficult top-floor ceilings (multiple layers, wire lath, tin, two ceilings etc)?</h3>
    
    <p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5.5%;width:40%;margin-right: 5.5%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/DifficultCeilings.gif"  alt="Nozzle held above joists to apply water to burning fuels (seat of fire) from a room without a difficult ceiling" style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-6&nbsp;  Try to find a room without the difficult ceiling</figcaption></figure></p>
    
	<p>Small-hole approaches (penetrating nozzles, 
				<span class = "tooltip">sharp angle<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage"><img src="images/SharpAngle.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Sharp angle technique--firefighting nozzle flowing a wide spray pattern is held in a void space and tilted so that some of its water is directed laterally toward the burning fuel surfaces.  Only a small fraction of its 360 degree pattern actually hits the fuels, but it can be enough to make stable progress."/></span></span></span>
		 etc) may work in some situations, but <strong>nozzle-above-the-joists</strong> is a more reliable solution—especially if you can find a room that doesn't have the difficult ceiling.&nbsp; Bathrooms and kitchens are good starting guesses. </p>
	
	<p>Second ceilings (drop ceilings) were generally installed room-by-room, and any fire in the added voids can be put out room-by-room in a separate battle.&nbsp; Be ready for collapse of the bottom ceiling.</p>	
    
    <h3>What effect does wind have?</h3>

	<p>In addition to changing the way fire spreads, wind can ruin your efforts to limit the fire's air supply.&nbsp; It can also restrict ventilation options, make size-up harder, and make sudden changes more likely.&nbsp; It often creates tough decisions.</p> 
    
        <p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5.5%;width:40%;margin-right:5.5%;margin-bottom: 5.5%;Margin-top:2%;Float:right"><img src="images/NozzleUpwind.png"  alt="Nozzle held above joists to apply water to burning fuels (seat of fire) from upwind position." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-7&nbsp; Upwind position may be best in windy conditions</figcaption></figure></p>
	
	<p>Try to use the wind to your advantage but don't force a vent option that isn't really available.&nbsp; Don't be distracted by dancing flames.&nbsp; Stay focused on finding and wetting the burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; If the wind is having a big effect, nozzle-above-the-joists through an access hole at the upwind edge of the fire may be your best bet.</p>
    
    <p>Expect sudden changes.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3>What flow rates are needed for cockloft fires?</h3>
    
	<p>It depends on volume of fire and attack method chosen, but it's often not a big water situation until the roof starts collapsing.&nbsp; In the three-deckers that are common in the U.S. northeast, 50 GPM, hitting the right surfaces, is a lot of water.</p>
    
    
	<h3>What about the “rip it all down” approach to controlling cockloft fires?&nbsp; </h3>
    
	<p>In the rip-it-all-down approach, you try to expose and extinguish (pull and wet) faster than the fire can spread.&nbsp; Failing that, you rip down all of the top floor ceiling.</p>
    
    <p> It's a common tactic and succeeds fairly often among FFs who know enough to:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>start pulling where the fuels are already burning and</li>
        <li>avoid giving the fire more air than water.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The problem is that there are too many scenarios where this approach fails in a big way and leaves you without a good Plan B.&nbsp;  You should gauge your chances of success before you open a big air intake under the fire.</p>
    
    <p>There are eight sets of scenarios where the rip-it-all-down approach can be a long shot:</p>  
    
    <ul>    
        <li>Difficult top floor ceilings</li>

        <li>Fire coming up through multiple walls, chases etc</li>

        <li>High winds from a bad direction</li>
        
        <li>Large volume of the cockloft already involved</li>
        
        <li>Can't get a good roof hole</li>
        
        <li>Top-floor clutter impedes firefighter access below parts of the ceiling</li>
        
        <li>Manpower limitations</li>

        <li>Water supply limitations</li>
    </ul>   
	<p>Note that "manpower limitations" sometimes means that you can't send enough FFs into an area because they won't have enough room to work or because they won't have adequate escape routes available to them.</p>
    
    <p>(Side note:  A similar list of tough scenario sets exists for attic fires, with one addition — "Attic has flooring and/or storage that would impede access to the fire from below".)</p>
