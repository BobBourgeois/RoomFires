    Cockloft Fires etc
    
  </h1>
</header>
<p>Attacking a cockloft fire is about wetting the burning fuel surfaces and ventilating skillfully.</p>
	
<p>Gut reaction for many FFs is to “get ahead” of the fire and put water on the farthest reach of flame.  But knockdown is not about hitting flame.</p>
	
<p>A long flame across the underside of a roof deck can extend over a big area that is not pyrolyzing yet.  Applying water here can push the flame around, but it is probably the most difficult and least effective way to kill the fire.</p>	

<p>Knockdown is about wetting the surfaces that are making fuel gases.</p>
	
<p>Find those surfaces and paint them with water.  Start by knowing where the fire came from—how it got into the cockloft.  An electrical fire in the top floor ceiling is very different from a fire that is coming up the walls or chases; and both are very different from an exterior fire that enters through a soffit (porch fire etc).</p>

<p>If you do have a ceiling hole out ahead of the flame, you should be throwing water back toward the source of the fire.  The gold standard for cockloft attacks is a nozzle held above the joists.  The FF (keeping their head and body below the ceiling until the fire is controlled) directs the horizontal stream as needed and gets immediate feedback on the effect that it’s having.</p>
	
<p>Penetrating nozzles are also an option, as are combination nozzles using the sharp angle technique.  The key is to wet the surfaces that are actually burning and not just chase flame.</p>		
<p>As with many fires, it’s best to control air supply until you can control the fire with water.  That means limit ceiling openings and choose their locations.  Wind and the building’s cockloft vents can restrict your options, so be realistic when setting objectives.</p>	
	
<p>A roof hole can help by removing airborne fuel, and maybe by turning a long horizontal flame into a vertical flame.  If the cockloft is the only space that needs to be vented, let the interior crews keep control of the ceiling.  Don’t push it down.  They may want to limit the fire’s air supply; and they may be able to set up a helpful flow between a ceiling hole and the roof hole.</p>

<p>Check early for two ceilings and/or two roofs.</p>

	<p>The success of a cockloft attack may also depend on putting out fire that is coming up from below (porches, wall voids, chases etc).  It may be helpful to think of the two battles as separate tasks and make them separate assignments.  Consider physically separating the jobs with an above-the-joists cockloft attack from another room.</p>
	
	<p>When sizing up fire in walls and chases, don't forget about drop fire from melted tar and/or foamed plastic roofing products.</p>

	<h3>What effect does wind have?</h3>
	<p>In addition to changing the way the fire spreads, wind can change ventilation options, make size-up harder, and make sudden changes more likely.  It can create tough decisions.</p>  
	
		<p>Try to use the wind to your advantage but don't force a vent option that isn't really available.  Don't be distracted by dancing flames.  Stay focused on finding and wetting the burning fuel surfaces.  Nozzle-above-the-joists may be the only application method that will work if the wind is having a big effect.</p>
	
	<h3>What is needed for the nozzle-above-the-joists attack method?</h3>
	<p>Good interior ladder capabilities and manageable kickback at the nozzle (i.e. sensible flow rate).  </p>
	
	<p>Nozzle held flat, completely above the joists, shooting parallel to the ceiling.</p>
	
	<p>Information sharing among exterior eyes, top floor eyes, and roof eyes.</p>
	
	<p>Coordinated actions.</p>
	
	<h3>What flow rates are needed for cockloft fires?</h3>
	<p>It depends on volume of fire and attack method chosen, but it's generally not a big water situation until the roof starts collapsing.  In the three-deckers that are common in the northeast, 50 GPM, hitting the right surfaces, is a lot of water.</p>
