<p>Extinguishing a cockloft fire is about wetting the burning fuel surfaces and ventilating skillfully.&nbsp;  Don't stray from that mental model.</p>
	
<p>Gut reaction for many FFs is to “get ahead” of the fire and put water on its farthest reach.&nbsp; But <strong>control is not about working the leading edge.</strong></p>
<br>    
	
	         
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:9%;margin-top:.1em;margin-right:5.%; width:38%;float:left;"><img src="images/ApplyWater.png"  alt="Water should be applied to burning fuels (seat of the fire), not the leading edge of flame spreading across underside of roof deck" style ="width:100%;float:left;"/><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-2&nbsp;  Wet the pyrolyzing fuels, not the leading edge</figcaption></figure></p>
	
<p>Long flames across the underside of a roof deck can extend over a big area that is not 
	<span class = "tooltip">pyrolyzing<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat-driven processes that produce fuel gases from solid and liquid fuels</span></span></span> 
yet.&nbsp; Applying water in that area can push the flame around, but it won't be an easy or effective way to kill the fire.</p>	


<p>Control is about 
	  <span class = "tooltip">wetting the fuel surfaces <span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Steam inerting and gas cooling can help, but stable progress in cocklofts almost always requires wetting the burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; See <a href="FlameLength.html">Flame Length etc</a> and <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a></span></span></span>	
	that are already making fuel gases.</p>
	
<p>Find those surfaces and paint them with water.&nbsp; Start by knowing where the fire came from—how it got into the cockloft.&nbsp; An electrical fire in the top floor ceiling is very different from a fire coming up the walls or chases; and both are very different from an exterior fire coming in through a soffit.</p>
	
<p>(Don't rely on just a thermal imager to track fire above the ceiling.&nbsp;  It takes time for the fire's heat to go through building materials to the ceiling or roof membrane where it's visible to the imager.&nbsp; The delay can throw your decisions off.)</p>	
    
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5%;width:38%;margin-right: 5.5%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/NozzleAboveJoist.png"  alt="Nozzle held above joists to apply water to burning fuels (seat of fire)." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-3&nbsp;  Nozzle above joists</figcaption></figure></p>
    

<p>If you do have a ceiling hole out ahead of the flame, you should be throwing water back toward the source of the fire.&nbsp; The gold standard for cockloft attacks is a nozzle held above the joists.&nbsp; The FF (keeping their head and body below the ceiling until the fire is controlled) directs the horizontal stream and sees the effect that it’s having.</p>
	

	
	
<p>Penetrating nozzles are also an option, as are combination nozzles using the 
		<span class = "tooltip">sharp angle technique.<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage"><img src="images/SharpAngle.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Sharp angle technique"/></span></span></span>
	&nbsp; The key is to wet the surfaces that are actually burning and not just chase flame.</p>
	
<br/>
    

    
	
<p>Try to <strong>restrict the fire’s air supply</strong> by limiting ceiling holes until you’re ready to put water where it's needed.&nbsp; Wind and the building’s cockloft vents may work against you, so be realistic in your expectations.</p>	
    
<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5%;width:38%;margin-right: 5.5%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/CLoftWhiteBrick.png"  alt="Cockloft on four-story apartment building." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-4&nbsp;  Cockloft with decorative cornice</figcaption></figure></p>	
    
<p>No easy rule governs roof ventilation.&nbsp;  Make your decision based on conditions, available protective measures, and likely benefits.&nbsp;  A roof hole can have some combination of <strong>four possible objectives:</strong></p> 
<ul>
	<li>draw the fire in a good direction;</li>
	<li>turn a horizontal flame into a vertical flame;</li>
	<li>remove airborne fuel			
		<span class = "tooltip">(AF)<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >In this context, airborne fuel includes pyrolosis gases and partially-burned fuels.&nbsp; See <a href="FlameLength.html#AFdef">Flame Length etc</a> for a more general discussion.</span></span></span>;</li>
	<li>improve conditions for the inside crews.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're sure that the cockloft is the only space that needs to be vented, consider letting the interior crews keep control of the ceiling—not pushing it down.&nbsp; They might want to limit the fire’s air supply; and they may be able to set up a helpful flow between a ceiling hole and the roof hole.</p>	

<p>Check early for two ceilings and/or two roofs.</p>

	<p>The success of a cockloft attack can also depend on putting out fire that is coming up from below (porches, wall voids, chases etc).&nbsp; It may be helpful to think of the two battles as separate jobs and make them separate assignments.&nbsp; Consider physically separating the jobs by using an above-the-joists cockloft attack from another room.</p>
	
	<p>When sizing up fire in walls and chases, don't forget about drop fire from melted tar and/or foamed plastic roofing products.</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>After the fire, get photos of the roof deck (from above and below) for the after-action review.  Also take shots of the fire's path into the cockloft and any building features that helped or hindered your efforts.</p>

<section class="RQs"><h2>Questions</h2>
	<h3>What about difficult top-floor ceilings (multiple layers, wire lath, tin, two ceilings etc)?</h3>
    
    <p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5.5%;width:40%;margin-right: 5.5%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right"><img src="images/DifficultCeilings.gif"  alt="Nozzle held above joists to apply water to burning fuels (seat of fire) from a room without a difficult ceiling" style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-6&nbsp;  Try to find a room without the difficult ceiling</figcaption></figure></p>
    
	<p>Small-hole approaches (penetrating nozzles, 
				<span class = "tooltip">sharp angle<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage"><img src="images/SharpAngle.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Sharp angle technique"/></span></span></span>
		 etc) may work in some situations, but <strong>nozzle-above-the-joists</strong> is a more reliable solution—especially if you can find a room that doesn't have the difficult ceiling.&nbsp; Bathrooms and kitchens are good starting guesses. </p>
	
	<p>Second ceilings (drop ceilings) were generally installed room-by-room, and any fire in the added voids can be put out room-by-room in a separate battle.&nbsp; Be ready for collapse of the bottom ceiling.</p>	
    
    <h3>What effect does wind have?</h3>

	<p>In addition to changing the way fire spreads, wind can ruin your efforts to limit the fire's air supply.&nbsp; It can also restrict ventilation options, make size-up harder, and make sudden changes more likely.&nbsp; It often creates tough decisions.</p> 
    
        <p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5.5%;width:40%;margin-right:5.5%;margin-bottom: 5.5%;Margin-top:2%;Float:right"><img src="images/NozzleUpwind.png"  alt="Nozzle held above joists to apply water to burning fuels (seat of fire) from upwind position." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 5-7&nbsp; Upwind position may be best in windy conditions</figcaption></figure></p>
	
	<p>Try to use the wind to your advantage but don't force a vent option that isn't really available.&nbsp; Don't be distracted by dancing flames.&nbsp; Stay focused on finding and wetting the burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; If the wind is having a big effect, nozzle-above-the-joists through an access hole at the upwind edge of the fire may be your best bet.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3>What flow rates are needed for cockloft fires?</h3>
	<p>It depends on volume of fire and attack method chosen, but it's generally not a big water situation until the roof starts collapsing.&nbsp; In the three-deckers that are common in the U.S. northeast, 50 GPM, hitting the right surfaces, is a lot of water.</p>
