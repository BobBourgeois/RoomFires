<p>Attacking a <span class = "tooltip">cockloft<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >A cockloft is the void space between a flat roof and the joists of the top floor ceiling.  The term is not used for truss construction.</span></span></span> fire is about wetting the burning fuel surfaces and ventilating skillfully.</p>
	
<p>Gut reaction for many FFs is to “get ahead” of the fire and put water on the farthest reach of flame.&nbsp; But knockdown is not about hitting flame.</p>
	
<p>A long flame across the underside of a roof deck can extend over a big area that is not <span class = "tooltip">pyrolyzing<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat-driven chemical reactions that produce fuel gases from solid & liquid fuels</span></span></span> yet.&nbsp; Applying water here can push the flame around, but it won't be an easy or effective way to kill the fire.</p>	

<p>Knockdown is about wetting the surfaces that are making fuel gases.</p>
	
<p>Find those surfaces and paint them with water.&nbsp; Start by knowing where the fire came from—how it got into the cockloft.&nbsp; An electrical fire in the top floor ceiling is very different from a fire coming up the walls or chases; and both are very different from an exterior fire coming in through a soffit (porch fire etc).</p>
	
<p>Don't rely on just a TIC to track fire above the ceiling.&nbsp;  It takes time for the fire's heat to go through building materials (insulation, joists, plaster etc) to the ceiling or roof membrane where it's visible to the imager.&nbsp; The delay can throw your decisions off.</p>	

<p>If you do have a ceiling hole out ahead of the flame, you should be throwing water back toward the source of the fire.&nbsp; The gold standard for cockloft attacks is a nozzle held above the joists.&nbsp; The FF (keeping their head and body below the ceiling until the fire is controlled) directs the horizontal stream and sees the effect that it’s having.</p>
	
<p>Penetrating nozzles are also an option, as are combination nozzles using the sharp angle technique.&nbsp; The key is to wet the surfaces that are actually burning and not just chase flame.</p>
	
<p>Try to restrict the fire’s air supply by limiting ceiling holes until you’re ready to put water where it's needed.&nbsp; Wind and the building’s cockloft vents may work against you, so be realistic in your expectations.</p>	
	
<p>A roof hole can have some combination of four objectives:&nbsp; draw the fire in a good direction; turn a horizontal flame into a vertical flame; remove airborne fuel; improve conditions for the inside crews.&nbsp; If you're sure that the cockloft is the only space that needs to be vented, let the interior crews keep control of the ceiling.&nbsp; Don’t push it down.&nbsp; They may want to limit the fire’s air supply; and they may be able to set up a helpful flow between a ceiling hole and the roof hole.</p>	

<p>Check early for two ceilings and/or two roofs.</p>

	<p>The success of a cockloft attack may also depend on putting out fire that is coming up from below (porches, wall voids, chases etc).&nbsp; It may be helpful to think of the two battles as separate tasks and make them separate assignments.&nbsp; Consider physically separating the jobs with an above-the-joists cockloft attack from another room.</p>
	
	<p>When sizing up fire in walls and chases, don't forget about drop fire from melted tar and/or foamed plastic roofing products.</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>After the fight, get photos of the roof deck (from above and below) for the after-action review.  Also take shots of the fire's path into the cockloft, and any building features that helped or hindered your efforts.</p>

	<h3>What effect does wind have?</h3>
	<p>In addition to changing the way the fire spreads, wind can change ventilation options, make size-up harder, and make sudden changes more likely.&nbsp; It can create tough decisions.</p>  
	
		<p>Try to use the wind to your advantage but don't force a vent option that isn't really available.&nbsp; Don't be distracted by dancing flames.&nbsp; Stay focused on finding and wetting the burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; If the wind is having a big effect, nozzle-above-the-joists with an access hole at the upwind edge of the fire may be your best bet.</p>
	
	<h3>What is needed for a good nozzle-above-the-joists attack?</h3>
	<p>Good interior ladder capabilities and manageable kickback at the nozzle (i.e. sensible flow rate).  </p>
	
	<p>Nozzle held flat, completely above the joists, shooting parallel to the ceiling.</p>
	
	<p>Information sharing among exterior eyes, top floor eyes, and roof eyes.</p>
	
	<p>Coordinated actions.</p>
	
	<h3>What about difficult top-floor ceilings (wire lath, tin, two ceilings etc)?</h3>
	<p>Small-hole approaches (penetrating nozzles, sharp-angle etc) may work in some situations, but nozzle-above-the-joists is a more reliable solution—especially if you can find a ceiling area that doesn't have the wire lath etc.&nbsp; Bathrooms and kitchens are good starting guesses. </p>
	
	<p>Second ceilings were generally installed room-by-room, and any fire in the added voids can be put out room-by-room in a separate battle.&nbsp; Be ready for collapse of the bottom ceiling.</p>	
	
	<h3>What flow rates are needed for cockloft fires?</h3>
	<p>It depends on volume of fire and attack method chosen, but it's generally not a big water situation until the roof starts collapsing.&nbsp; In the three-deckers that are common in the northeast, 50 GPM, hitting the right surfaces, is a lot of water.</p>
