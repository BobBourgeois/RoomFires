  <p>Fire attack with automatic nozzles is mostly about wetting fuel surfaces—just like fire attack with fixed-flow and adjustable-flow nozzles.  The advantages of the automatic nozzle come from adaptivity and ease of use.</p>
  <p>It’s a tool that extends the flexibility of variable spray patterns by adding easy and effective delivery of a wide range of flow rates .  A team can choose a good-for-most-cases default flow rate, knowing that they can adjust up or down as the situation dictates.  This confident flexibility can ease the GPM anxiety that causes many teams to always flow big water.</p>
  <p>A 16 x 12 room with an 8 ft ceiling requires less than 20 GPM.  If you’re flowing 90-100 GPM, you have a generous safety margin.  Double that room size and you still have a good margin.  If you’re routinely flowing much more than 100 GPM for residential room fires, you might want to downthink.</p>

  <p>In addition to easing water supply requirements (and water supply anxiety), a lower flow rate can cut FF exertion and help with nozzle placement.  Many good stops have been made by nozzles held in awkward orientations (e.g. above the joists for a cockloft fire).  In situations like that, flowing six or seven times the required water makes the job harder and might rob you of speed and adaptivity.</p>

	<p>Straight streams do most of the work in firefighting but spray patterns have high value in some important situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easier to protect people directly threatened by flame (and more effective)</li>
		<li>Easier to power vent a door, window, or even a narrow hallway</li>
		<li>Easier to apply water at sharp angles</li>
		<li>Easier to cool a tank</li>
		<li>Easier to wet broad surface areas</li>
		<li>Easier to wet the dozens/hundreds of surfaces in a trussloft?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What are the drawbacks of automatic nozzles?</h3>
	<p>Compared to smooth bore, they are more likely to be clogged by debris and they require more mainenance.  Compared to other adjustable-pattern (combination) nozzles, their maintenance is more involved.  Their cost is likely to be higher than both.</p>
	<h3>How is the flow adjustment actually made?</h3>
	<p>GPM can be adjusted by changing the pump dishcarge pressure (PDP), or by changing the bale position.  Each has its pros and cons but a team should probably choose one method and use it most of the time because coordination is required for both.</p>
	<h3>How should we handle pressure calculations?</h3>
	<p>Field calculations are not a good idea because they’re needless and wildly inaccurate.</p>
	<p>Automatic nozzles operate in a range of nozzle pressures (NPs) that is smaller than the uncertainty in friction loss estimates and much smaller than the actual range of friction losses.  Available calcs can't deal with that.</p>
	<p>A better approach is to do some testing.  Learn a good starting pressure for each of your preconnects and then practice adjusting up and down.  You’ll get a feel for your situation and be able to describe it to others.  Do the same for other layouts if you want.</p>
	<h3>What does “easier” mean in this context?</h3>
	<p>Requires less skill, less exertion, less attention</p>
	<h3>What are some other situations when a nozzle might be used "in an awkward position”?</h3>
		<p>Nozzle placed inside a pipe chase, shooting up or down</p>
		<p>Nozzle placed inside a bay of a balloon-framed wall, shooting up or down</p>
		<p>Nozzle placed behind a knee wall, shooting parallel to the wall</p>
		<p>Nozzle held through a window, wetting the inside of the wall that the window is in.</p>
	
	<h3>Describe “applying water at sharp angles”.</h3>
	<p>At its widest setting a spray patterns is required to be at least 50 degrees off the centerline.  A user only has to tilt the nozzle 40 degrees to apply water at a right angle.  They can stand outside of a window, reach in and easily wet everything in the room that isn’t shielded, including the inside of the window wall.  They can also wet inaccessible surfaces behind kneewalls, in cocklofts, and in other voids.</p>

<section class="Wisdom">
  <p>If your calculation is no more accurate than my guess, you should learn how to guess.</p>
	<p>Fight the fire in front of you—not the theoretical one that you think you understand.
