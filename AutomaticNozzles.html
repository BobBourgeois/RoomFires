<p>Fire attack with an automatic nozzle is mostly about wetting fuel surfaces—just like fire attack with a fixed-flow or adjustable-flow nozzle.&nbsp; The extra value comes from adaptivity and ease of use.</p>
  <p>Automatic nozzles combine the versatility of adjustable spray patterns with the versatility of a wide range of flow rates in a tool that is easy to use if you don’t overthink it.&nbsp; A team chooses a good-for-most-cases default flow and knows that they can adjust up or down if necessary.</p>
	
  <p>This confident flexibility can ease the GPM anxiety that causes many teams to always flow big water.&nbsp; Using 90-100 GPM to attack a 16' x 16' x 8' room gives you a generous safety margin.&nbsp; Double the room size and you still have a good margin.&nbsp; If you’re routinely flowing much more than 100 GPM for residential room fires, you might want to downthink.</p>

  <p>In addition to easing water supply needs (and water supply anxiety), a lower flow rate can cut FF exertion, cut air use, and help with nozzle placement.&nbsp; Many good stops have been made by nozzles held in awkward orientations (e.g. above the joists for a cockloft fire).&nbsp; In situations like that, flowing six or seven times the required water makes the job much harder and might rob you of speed and adaptivity.</p>
	<p>On those rare occasions when you do need more water or more reach, you simply flow more water.</p>

	<p>Straight streams do most of the work in firefighting but spray patterns have high value in some important situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Easier to protect people directly threatened by flame (and more effective)</li>
		<li>Easier to power vent a door, window, or even a narrow hallway</li>
		<li>Easier to apply water at sharp angles</li>
		<li>Easier to cool a tank</li>
		<li>Easier to wet broad surface areas</li>
		<li>Easier to wet the dozens/hundreds of surfaces in a trussloft</li>
	</ul>

<section class="RQs"><h2>RQs</h2>
	<h3>What does “easier” mean in this context?</h3>
	<p>Requires less skill, less exertion, less attention.&nbsp; More likely to succeed.</p>
	
	<h3>What are the drawbacks of automatic nozzles?</h3>
	<p>Compared to smooth bore, they require more maintenance and they are more likely to be partly clogged by water-born debris.&nbsp; Compared to other adjustable-pattern (combination) nozzles, their maintenance is more involved.&nbsp; Their cost is likely to be higher than both.</p>
	
	<h3>How is the flow adjustment actually made?</h3>
	<p>GPM can be adjusted by changing the pump discharge pressure or by changing the bale position.&nbsp; Each has its pros and cons but a team should probably choose one method and use it most of the time because coordination is required for both.</p>
	
	<h3>How should pressure calculations be done?</h3>
	<p>Field calculations are not a good idea because they are needless and wildly inaccurate.</p>
	<p>Automatic nozzles operate in a range of nozzle pressures that is smaller than the uncertainty in friction loss estimates and much smaller than the actual range of friction losses.&nbsp; Available calcs can't deal with that.</p>
	<p>A better approach is to do some testing.&nbsp; Find a good starting pressure for each of your preconnects and then practice adjusting up and down.&nbsp; You’ll get a feel for your situation and be able to describe it to others.&nbsp; Do the same for other layouts if you want.</p>
	
	<h3>What are some other situations when a nozzle might be used "in an awkward orientation”?</h3>
		<p>Nozzle placed inside a pipe chase, shooting up or down</p>
		<p>Nozzle placed inside a bay of a balloon-framed wall, shooting up or down</p>
		<p>Nozzle placed behind a knee wall, shooting parallel to the wall</p>
		<p>Nozzle held through a window, wetting the inside of the wall that the window is in.</p>
	
	<h3>Describe “applying water at sharp angles”.</h3>
	<p>At its widest setting, a spray pattern is required to throw water at least 50 degrees off the centerline.&nbsp; A user can simply tilt the nozzle and apply water at more than 90 degrees.&nbsp; They can easily hit all four walls of a room while standing in the doorway or outside of a window.</p>
	<p>When chasing fire through the voids of a building, the wide pattern is an option to quickly wet inaccessible surfaces behind kneewalls, in cocklofts, etc.</p>

<section class="Wisdom">
  <p>If your calculation is no more accurate than my guess, you should learn how to guess.</p>
	<p>Adaptivity is priceless in a firefighter's work environment.
