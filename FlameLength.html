<p>Structural firefighters should know two things about flame length.</p>	
	
<p>At building fires, flame length is a clue about   
		<span class = "tooltip"><strong>how much airborne fuel</strong><span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" ><a href="#AFdef">Airborne fuels</a> include pyrolysis gases, partially burned fuels, vapors from liquids, and normally gaseous fuels.</span></span></span> 
	 (AF) is in a fire atmosphere.&nbsp; Simply stated, more fuel makes a flame stretch until it finds more air to burn the fuel.</p>
	
<p>It is an indicator to be used in combination with smoke, wind, building layout,  and other clues.&nbsp; Look for patterns and changes.&nbsp; Ask questions.&nbsp; Where are the pockets of AF?&nbsp; Is it building up?&nbsp; Spreading?&nbsp; Can it be vented?&nbsp; Is the fire attack stopping the production of AF?</p>

<p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:5%;width:30%;Margin-top:.1em;Float:right;padding-right: 1%"><img src="images/FlameLengthsVComposite.png"  alt="Flame length across a ceiling, from a window, and from a roof hole." style="width:100%;Padding-right:1.6em;"><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 4-2&nbsp;  Flame lengths</figcaption></figure></p>   
    
<p>We usually notice the size of flames when they blow from windows and roof holes.&nbsp;  Equally important is their stretch across ceilings and the underside of roof decks.&nbsp; The <strong>length of these sideways flames</strong> can be critical to the course of the incident — maybe determining how fast the fire will spread or how far it can reach to hurt someone.&nbsp;  Less obviously, it might also affect your ability to make progress against the fire.</p>
	
<p>
Remember that 
    <span class = "tooltip">stable or semi-stable<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage">See <a href="index.html">Room Fires etc</a><img src="images/F2.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Progress stability animation.  Unstable, semi-stable, and stable progress represented as darkening.  Areas darkened by unstable progress immediately revert to prior state.  Areas darkened by semi-stable progress gradually revert.  Areas darkened by stable progress remain dark."/></span></span></span> 
	 progress against fire comes from cooling surfaces that are producing fuel gases 
		<span class = "tooltip">(pyrolysis).<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat-driven processes that produce fuel gases from solid and liquid fuels</span></span></span>
	&nbsp; Long horizontal flames can have a sizeable area where pyrolysis is not occuring.&nbsp; Water hitting that part of the visible fire won't help you make real headway.
</p>
	
<p>If a crew doesn't understand, they may chase the flame pointlessly and/or misread the problem as not enough GPM.</p>
	
</section>
<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>A long horizontal flame across the underside of a combustible surface (e.g. roof deck) can have 
			<span class = "tooltip">three sections:<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage"><img src="images/ApplyWater.png" width="382" height="206" alt="Fire spreading across underside of roof deck, showing that water should be applied to burning fuels (seat of the fire), not the leading edge of flame."/></span></span></span>	
		</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A <strong>pyrolysis-only</strong> section (enough heat for pyrolysis but not enough oxygen for flame).&nbsp;— Wetting this area will help.</li>
		<li>A <strong>pyrolysis-and-flame</strong> section.&nbsp;— Wetting this area will help.</li>
		<li>A <strong>flame-only</strong> section (not enough heat for pyrolysis yet).&nbsp;— Wetting this area will probably not be effective in reducing AF or putting the fire out.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The situation under a noncombustible surface will be simpler in many scenarios—one section that is flame-only.&nbsp;   For some scenarios, though, there is another consideration.&nbsp;  Heat is transferred to combustible materials and pyrolysis occurs without direct flame contact.</p>

<p>An important example is steel roof decking topped with combustible roof products.&nbsp;  Heat conducted through the steel can pyrolyze the roof products (tar, foamed plastics etc).&nbsp;  Wetting the steel might not help you make progress against the exposing fire but may be useful to stop the pyrolysis topside. </p>
    
 <p>And don't forget that for all three section types, water can play an additional role if it travels on to wet other burning fuels.</p>
    
 
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>One of the universal warnings in the fire service is “expect sudden changes”.&nbsp; There are many types of rapid events, but fast changes in fire conditions are some of the most deadly and most talked-about.&nbsp; Training, near-miss reports, and LODD reports are peppered with terms that mean either “airborne fuel burned suddenly” or “a flame extended quickly”.&nbsp; Don't overthink the hair-splitting jargon.&nbsp; It is more important to know that AF is a common factor</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>When using a still photo in an after-action review or training session, don't forget that some of what you see is transient.&nbsp; A single pic doesn't tell you if a long window flame was steady or if it was a brief flare.&nbsp; Was it fed by a continuous supply of AF or just a pocket of AF that vented when the window broke?</p>

	</section>
<section class="RQs"><h2>Questions</h2>
	<h3>Many FFs have been taught that smoke is fuel.&nbsp; Can’t they just look at the amount of smoke to gauge the amount of airborne fuels?</h3>
	<p>No.</p>
	<p>FFs should be taught that <strong>smoke is sometimes fuel</strong> and also that pyrolysis gases are sometimes transparent.&nbsp; There are clues in the smoke about airborne fuel, but they should be viewed with flame length and other clues.</p>
	
	<h3 id="AFdef">What is included in the term “airborne fuels”?</h3>
	<p>Pyrolysis products<br> (pyrolysates)</p>
	<p>Partially-burned fuels <br>
    (Many fuels burn in a chain reaction.&nbsp; If the chain is interrupted, the halfway products become available fuel.)</p>
	<p>Vapors from flammable or combustible liquids that may be present<br>
	(Spills or deliberate acts)</p>
	<p>Natural gas, propane or other commercially available gases that may be present<br>
	(Leaks, relief valves, deliberate acts)</p>
