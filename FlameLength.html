    Flame Length etc
    
  </h1>
</header>
<p>At building fires, flame length is one indicator of how much airborne fuel (AF) is in a fire atmosphere.  Simply stated, more fuel makes a flame stretch until it finds more air to burn the fuel.</p>
	
<p>Read flame length in combination with smoke, wind, building layout and other clues.  Look for patterns and changes.  Ask questions.  Where are the pockets of AF?  Is it accumulating? Spreading? Can it be vented? Is the fire attack stopping the production of AF?</p>

<p>We all notice the length of a flame blowing out a window or through a roof hole, but sometimes the flame is extending across a ceiling or the underside of a roof deck.  The length of these sideways flames can be critical to the course of the incident.  It may be how far the fire can reach to hurt someone.  It may be how fast the fire can spread.  It may be the reason that knockdown is not happening.</p>
<p>Stable or semi-stable extinguishment progress comes from wetting the fuel surfaces that are producing fuel gases(pyrolysis).  Long horizontal flames can cover a sizeable area where pyrolysis is not occurring yet.  Water applied to that part of the flame does not reduce the production of AF.  If a crew fails to recognize that they are only hitting flame and not the burning fuels, they may chase the flame pointlessly and/or misread the problem as inadequate GPM</p>

<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>A long horizontal flame across the underside of a combustible surface (think roof deck) can have three sections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A pyrolysis-only section where there is enough heat for pyrolysis but not enough oxygen for flame.  Water applied here will be effective.</li>
		<li>A pyrolysis-and-flame section.  Water applied here will be effective</li>
		<li>A flame-only section where there is not enough heat for pyrolysis.  Water applied here will probably not be effective in reducing AF or putting the fire out.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One of the universal warnings in the fire service is “expect sudden changes.”  We see many types of rapid events, but fast changes in fire conditions are some of the most deadly and most talked-about.  Training, near-miss reports, and LODD reports are peppered with jargon that means either “airborne fuel burned suddenly” or “a long flame extended quickly”.  Being able to use the correct jargon is less important than knowing that AF is a common factor</p>
	<p>When using still photos as evidence in after-action reviews and training sessions, we should remind ourselves that some of what we see may be transient.  A photo showing a long window flame doesn’t tell us if that length held steady for several minutes or if it lasted only a few seconds.  Does it show a steady supply of AF or just a pocket that vented when the window broke?</p>

	<h3>FFs have been taught that smoke is fuel.  Can’t we just look at the amount of smoke to gauge the amount of airborne fuels?</h3>
	<p>No.</p>
	<p>FFs should be taught that smoke is sometimes fuel and also that pyrolysis gases are sometimes transparent.  There are clues in the smoke about airborne fuel, but they should be considered in combination with flame length and other clues.</p>
	
	<h3>What is included in the term “airborne fuels”?</h3>
	<p>Pyrolysis gases</p>
	<p>Partially burned fuels <br>
    (Many fuels burn in a chain reaction.  If the chain is interrupted, the halfway products become available fuel.)</p>
	<p>Vapors from flammable or combustible liquids that may be present.<br>
	(Spills or deliberate acts)</p>
	<p>Natural gas, propane or other commercially available fuel gases.<br>
	(Leaks, relief valve activations, deliberate acts)</p>
