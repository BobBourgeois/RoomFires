<p>The best structural firefighters know a couple of  things about flame length.</p>	
	
<p>At building fires, flame length is a clue about how much <strong>airborne fuel</strong> 
		<span class = "tooltip">(AF)<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" ><a href="#AFdef">Airborne fuels</a> include pyrolysis gases, partially burned fuels, vapors from liquids, and normally gaseous fuels.</span></span></span> 
	is in a fire atmosphere.&nbsp; Simply stated, more fuel makes a flame stretch until it finds more air to burn the fuel.
</p>
	
<p>Read this clue with smoke, wind, building layout,  and other clues.&nbsp; Look for patterns and changes.&nbsp; Ask questions.&nbsp; Where are the pockets of AF?&nbsp; Is it building up?&nbsp; Spreading?&nbsp; Can it be vented?&nbsp; Is the fire attack stopping the production of AF?</p>
	
<p><figure>
		<img src="images/FromWindow.png"  alt="" style="padding-left:3.2em;width:26%;"/><img src="images/FromRoof.png"  alt="" style="padding-left:.2em;width:26%;"/><img src="images/AcrossCeiling.png"  alt="" style="padding-left:.2em;width:26%;"/>
		<figcaption>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig.1&nbsp;  Flame length</figcaption>
		</figure></p>	

<p>We notice a flame's length when it blows out a window or through a roof hole, but sometimes it's extending across a ceiling or the underside of a roof deck.&nbsp; The length of these sideways flames can be critical to the course of the incident.&nbsp; It may be how far the fire can reach to hurt someone.&nbsp; It may be how fast the fire can spread.&nbsp; It may also be the reason that knockdown is not happening.</p>
	
<p>
		<span class = "tooltip">Stable or semi-stable<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage">See <a href="Index.html">Room Fires etc</a><img src="images/F2.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Stability animation"/></span></span></span> 
	 progress against a fire comes from wetting surfaces that are producing fuel gases 
		<span class = "tooltip">(pyrolysis).<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat-driven processes that produce fuel gases from solid and liquid fuels</span></span></span>
	&nbsp; The catch is that long horizontal flames can have a sizeable area where pyrolysis isn't occuring.&nbsp; Water hitting that area does not reduce the production of AF.
</p>
	
<p>If a crew doesn't understand, they may chase the flame pointlessly and/or misread the problem as not enough GPM.</p>
	
</section>
<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>A long horizontal flame across the underside of a combustible surface (think roof deck) can have three sections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <strong>pyrolysis-only</strong> section (enough heat for pyrolysis but not enough oxygen for flame).&nbsp; Wetting this area will help.</li>
		<li>A <strong>pyrolysis-and-flame</strong> section.&nbsp; Wetting this area will help.</li>
		<li>A <strong>flame-only</strong> section (not enough heat for pyrolysis yet).&nbsp; Water applied here will probably not be effective in reducing AF or putting the fire out.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>One of the universal warnings in the fire service is “expect sudden changes”.&nbsp; There are many types of rapid events, but fast changes in fire conditions are some of the most deadly and most talked-about.&nbsp; Training, near-miss reports, and LODD reports are peppered with terms that mean either “airborne fuel burned suddenly” or “a flame extended quickly”.&nbsp; Don't overthink the hair-splitting jargon.&nbsp; It is more important to know that AF is a common factor</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>When using a still photo in an after-action review or training session, don't forget that some of what you see is transient.&nbsp; A single pic doesn't tell you if a long window flame was steady or if it was a brief flare.&nbsp; Was it fed by a continuous supply of AF or just a pocket of AF that vented when the window broke?</p>

<section class="RQs"><h2>RQs</h2>
	<h3>Many FFs have been taught that smoke is fuel.&nbsp; Can’t they just look at the amount of smoke to gauge the amount of airborne fuels?</h3>
	<p>No.</p>
	<p>FFs should be taught that <strong>smoke is sometimes fuel</strong> and also that pyrolysis gases are sometimes transparent.&nbsp; There are clues in the smoke about airborne fuel, but they should be viewed with flame length and other clues.</p>
	
	<h3><a id="AFdef">What is included in the term “airborne fuels”?</a></h3>
	<p>Pyrolysis gases</p>
	<p>Partially-burned fuels <br>
    (Many fuels burn in a chain reaction.&nbsp; If the chain is interrupted, the halfway products become available fuel.)</p>
	<p>Vapors from flammable or combustible liquids that may be present<br>
	(Spills or deliberate acts)</p>
	<p>Natural gas, propane or other commercially available fuel gases that may be present<br>
	(Leaks, relief valves, deliberate acts)</p>
