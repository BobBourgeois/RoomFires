  <p>Knockdown of a well-involved room fire is mostly about wetting fuel surfaces.&nbsp;  Wetting the burning fuels quickly cuts the rates of heat release and fuel-gas production (pyrolysis).</p>
	
  <p>It is not necessary to absorb the heat release rate (HRR) for the whole room—just for the surface area that is being hit by water at the moment.&nbsp;  If that area does not reignite immediately, the stream can make progress by wetting more fuel.&nbsp; If most burning fuel surfaces can be painted with water, the knockdown happens in seconds.</p>
	
  <p>Two progress-related concepts go a little deeper:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The first is <strong>progress instability</strong>—how quickly the fire could grow back.&nbsp; If you imagine an interruption in water flow:&nbsp; <strong>stable</strong>  progress will persist after the water stops; <strong>unstable</strong> progress can quickly be lost (fire flashes back). </li>
		
		<li>Water's progress will be stable on burning leaves and unstable on gasoline pool fires.&nbsp; Well-involved room fires live in between.&nbsp; <strong>Semi-stable</strong> progress persists for a short time as the stream moves on.</li>
	  
		<li>The other key concept is that, once you start making semi-stable progress against a room fire, you rapidly reduce the needed flow rate.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The initial GPM that will make semi-stable progress and darken down a room fire is situation-dependant, but it is the flow required to wet burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; Progress becomes more stable as more surface area becomes wet and stops pyrolizing. </p>
	
	<p>Stopping pyrolysis of fuels is like stopping the flow of gas at a gas-fed fire.</p>
	
</section>
<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>These concepts also apply to fire in the voids of a building, but problems with detection and access often make it hard to wet all of the burning surfaces.</p>
	
	<p>Fires on the outside of buildings (porches etc) tend to be fuel-controlled and have exposed fuel surfaces.&nbsp; It is easy to make semi-stable and stable progress.&nbsp; Modest flow rates achieve surprisingly good results.</p>
	
	<p>Fires spreading through large areas, as in many commercial occupancies, may feature a race between the firefighters’ rate-of-progress and the fire’s rate-of-spread.&nbsp; Higher flow rates may be required. </p>
</section>
	
<section class="RQs"><h2>RQs</h2>
	<h3>Why is there a minimum flow (GPM) required to make semi-stable progress in a typical room fire?</h3>
	<p>Some water will turn to steam before it reaches a fuel surface and some will evaporate from the surfaces.&nbsp; You need each surface to stay wet for at least a few seconds.</p>
	
	<h3>Required GPM is related to volume of fire.&nbsp; What is the link between volume of fire and progress stability?</h3>
	<p>Larger bodies of fire are better at continuing to transfer heat to fuel surfaces.&nbsp; It takes a little more water to wet surfaces for the few seconds necessary.</p>
	
	<h3>How should people calculate the initial flow rates required to darken down room fires?</h3>
	<p>The Iowa formula (lwh/100) is based on testing and gives a reasonable estimate.&nbsp; In practice, it’s very easy to deliver a lot more water than you need, so don’t overthink it. </p>
	
	<h3>Does the presence of plastics increase the gpm required to knock down a room fire?</h3>
	<p>No. </p>
	<p>The fuels that might increase required gpm are those that affect progress stability.&nbsp; Gasoline is an example.&nbsp; Because gasoline’s flash point is much lower than the water's temperature, evaporation of its vapors cannot be stopped by the water.&nbsp; Fire can flash back over an area already doused.</p>
	<p>Even though parts of the room with no gasoline will darken down as usual, the overall knockdown might take a little more time and water.&nbsp; (The difference isn’t always noticeable because common flow rates are so much higher than required minimums.)</p>
	
	<h3>Are “direct attack” and “indirect attack” useful terms?</h3>
	<p>The usefulness of these terms is limited by their varying definitions.  I learned it as: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>A “direct attack” kills the fire mostly by wetting fuel surfaces.&nbsp; This includes water that hits the ceiling before it hits some other surface.</li>
		<li>An “indirect attack” knocks the fire mostly by making steam.&nbsp; As the phase change absorbs heat and the steam inerts the atmosphere, the flames are snuffed out.&nbsp; Fuel surfaces then cool by transferring heat to the enviroment.&nbsp; The production of fuel gases tapers off.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Using that definition, when is an indirect attack warranted?</h3>
	<p>In a few situations that combine:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Access difficulty</li>
	<li>Enough confinement to hold the steam while the fuels cool</li>
	<li>High levels of FF skill and coordination</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(FFs should be ready for sudden changes during an indirect attack, since progress may be unstable.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Wisdom">
	<p>Put water on the stuff that's burning.&nbsp; If the fire doesn't go out, it's probably because you didn't hit all the stuff.</p>
	<p>A building fire isn't out until the fuels are cool and the atmosphere is vented.
