  <h1 id="DocTitle">Room Fires etc</h1>
  <p>Knockdown and extinguishment of a well-involved room fire is primarily about wetting fuel surfaces.  Wetting the fuels quickly reduces the rates of heat release and fuel-gas production (primarily pyrolosis).</p>
  <p>It is not necessary to absorb the heat release rate (HRR) for the entire room—just for the surface area that is being hit by water at the moment.  If that area does not reignite immediately, the stream can make progress by wetting more fuel.  If most fuel surfaces can be painted with water, the initial knockdown happens in seconds.</p>
  <p>Two progress-related concepts help us understand the dynamics a little more deeply:</p>
  <ul><li>The first concept is progress instability—how quickly the fire can undo the headway that we’re making.  We can understand progress instability by imagining what will happen if the flow of water is suddenly interrupted.  Stable extinguishment progress will persist when the water stops.   Unstable progress can quickly be lost (fire flashes back) when the water stops.  Water ordinarily makes stable progress on burning leaves and unstable progress on a gasoline pool fire.  Well-involved room fires live in between—progress can be semi-stable.  Semi-stable progress will persist for a short time, allowing the stream to be redirected as needed.</li><li>The other key concept is that, once you begin making semi-stable progress against a room fire, the required flow rate decreases rapidly—oftentimes exponentially.</li></ul>
  <p>The initial GPM required to make semi-stable progress and darken down a room fire is situation-dependant but it is the flow required to wet fuel surfaces.  Progress becomes more stable as more surface area becomes wet and stops pyrolizing. Stopping pyrolosis of fuels is like stopping the flow of gas at a gas-fed fire.</p>

<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>These concepts apply similarly to fires in the voids of a building but problems with detection and access often make it hard to wet all of the burning surfaces.</p>
	<p>Control methods that depend primarily on steam to smother the gas-phase reactions (Layman’s indirect attack etc)   may be appropriate in a narrow range of situations that combine access difficulty with enough confinement to hold the steam while the fuels cool.  They are very dependent on the skill and coordination of the users (who should always be ready for sudden changes since progress may be unstable). </p>
	<p>Fires on the outside of buildings (porches etc) tend to be fuel-controlled and have exposed fuel surfaces.  It is easy to achieve semi-stable and stable progress.  Modest flow rates achieve surprisingly good results.</p>
	<p>Fires spreading through large areas, as in many commercial occupancies, are also extinguished by wetting fuel surfaces but may feature a race between the firefighters’ rate-of-progress and the fire’s rate-of-spread.  Higher flow rates may be required. </p>

<section class="RQs"><h2>RQs</h2>
	<h3>Why is there a minimum flow (gpm) required to make semi-stable progress in a typical room fire?</h3>
	<p>Some water will turn to steam before it reaches a fuel surface and some will evaporate from the surfaces.  We need each surface to stay wet for at least a few seconds.</p>
	<h3>We know that required GPM is related to volume of fire.  What is the link between volume of fire and progress stability?</h3>
	<p>Larger bodies of fire are better at continuing to transfer heat to fuel surfaces.  It takes a little more water to wet surfaces for the few seconds necessary.</p>
	<h3>So how do we calculate the initial flow rates required to darken down room fires?</h3>
	<p>The Iowa formula (lwh/100) is based on testing and gives a reasonable estimate of the optimal GPM for room fires.  In practice, it’s very easy to deliver a lot more water than you need, so don’t overthink it. </p>
	<h3>Does the presence of plastics increase the gpm required to knock down a room fire?</h3>
	<p>No. </p>
	<p>The fuels that might increase the required gpm are those that affect progress stability.  Gasoline is an example.  Because gasoline’s flash point is much lower than the temperature of the water being applied, evaporation of its vapors cannot be stopped by the water.  Fire can flash back over an area already doused.</p>
	<p>Parts of the room with no gasoline may darken down as usual, but the overall knockdown time might be longer, and a higher initial flow rate may or may not be needed.  (The difference isn’t always noticeable because common flow rates are so much higher than required minimums.)</p>
	<h3>Are “direct attack” and “indirect attack” useful terms?</h3>
	<p>The usefulness of these terms is limited by their varying definitions.  I learned it as: </p>
	<ul><li>A “direct attack” knocks the fire down mostly by wetting fuel surfaces.  This includes water that hits the ceiling before it hits some other surface.</li><li>An “indirect attack” knocks the fire mostly by making steam.  As the phase change absorbs heat and the steam inerts the atmosphere, the flames are snuffed out.  Fuel surfaces then cool by transferring heat to the enviroment and the production of fuel gases tapers off.  Indirect attacks generally require some confinement to maintain the inert atmosphere while the fuels cool. </li></ul></section>
<section class="Wisdom">
  <p>PUT WATER ON THE STUFF THAT’S BURNING.  IF THE FIRE DOESN’T GO OUT, IT’S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU DIDN’T HIT ALL THE STUFF.</p>
	<p>A BUILDING FIRE ISN’T OUT UNTIL THE FUELS ARE COOL AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS VENTED.
