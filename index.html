<p>Room fires are a good starting point to revisit the basics of fighting fire with water <span style="font-size:.9rem">(first of six topics)</span>.&nbsp Although easy to understand, they have in recent decades been misunderstood in some costly ways.</p> 
    
<p>Killing a fully-involved room fire is mainly about <strong>wetting the burning fuel surfaces</strong> — choking off the supply of fuel gases by stopping the heat-driven reactions that produce them (pyrolysis).&nbsp;  No pyrolysis gases means no flames.</p>
	
<p>Killing the fire is <strong>not</strong> about absorbing all of the fire's heat 
	  <span class = "tooltip">(HRR).<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >Heat Release Rate</span></span></span>
&nbsp;  What matters is the surface area that water is hitting at the moment.&nbsp;  If that area goes out and does not reignite immediately, the stream can make progress by wetting more fuel.&nbsp; If you can make progress, you can put the fire out.&nbsp; If most burning fuel surfaces can be painted with water, knockdown happens in seconds.</p>
    
 
    
        <p><figure style="margin-left:inherit;padding-left:9%;margin-top:.1em;margin-right:2.8em; width:40%;float:left;"><img src="images/F4.gif"  alt="Unstable, semi-stable, and stable progress." style="width:100%;float:left;"/><figcaption style = "font-size:.8em;">Fig. 1-2&nbsp;  Progress instability</figcaption></figure></p>          
	
<p>Two progress-related concepts go a little deeper:</p>
	
	
        <p>The first is <strong>progress instability</strong>
		<!--	<span class = "tooltip"><strong>progress instability</strong><span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltipimage"><img src="images/F2.gif" width="382" height="206" alt="Stability animation"/></span></span></span>-->
		— how quickly the fire could grow back.&nbsp; If you imagine an interruption in water flow:&nbsp; <strong>stable</strong>  progress will persist after the water stops; <strong>unstable</strong> progress can quickly be lost (<span style="font-size:.97rem">fire flashes back</span>).</p> 
		
<p>		Water's progress will be stable on burning leaves and unstable on gasoline pool fires.&nbsp; Well-involved room fires live in between.&nbsp; <strong>Semi-stable</strong> progress persists for a short time.</p>
		
		<!--
        <li><figure>
		<img src="images/F2.gif"  alt="Unstable, semi-stable, and stable progress." style="padding-left:1em;width:50%;"/>
		<figcaption style="padding-left:1em;font-size:.8em;">Fig.1-2&nbsp;  Progress instability </figcaption> 
		</figure></li>
        //-->
	
<p>		The other key concept is that, once you start making semi-stable progress against a room fire, the <strong>required flow rate decreases</strong> rapidly.</p>
	
<br>
    
<p>Water puts fire out by three mechanisms:
    
   <ul>
    <li><strong>Fuel surface cooling</strong> — heat transfer at
              <span class = "tooltip">burning fuel surfaces<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >The burning fuel surfaces are sometimes called the "base" or "seat" of the fire but both terms can be misused or misinterpretated so I avoid them.</span></span></span>
         (mostly when water hits them.)</li>
    <li><strong>Steam inerting</strong> — displacement/dilution of air and fuel gases by steam.</li>
    <li> <strong>Gas cooling</strong> — heat transfer while water droplets are in flight.</li>
  </ul>
</p>    

<p>All three occur in most scenarios, but <strong>fuel surface cooling </strong>has the efficiency and progress stability to be the primary mechanism by far.&nbsp;  Stopping pyrolysis of fuels is like stopping the flow of gas at a gas-fed fire.</p>
    
<p>The minimum initial flow that will make semi-stable progress and darken down a room fire is situation-dependant, but it is the flow required to wet burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; Progress becomes more stable as more surface area becomes wet and stops pyrolizing. </p>
	

	
</section>
<section class="Etc"><h2>Etc</h2>
	<p>These concepts also apply to fires in the voids of buildings&nbsp; but problems with detection and access often make it hard to wet all the burning surfaces.&nbsp; Success in those cases comes from finding the fire and positioning the nozzle well—not from higher flow rates.</p>
	
	<p>Fires on the outside of buildings (<a  href="PorchFires.html" target="new">porches</a> etc) tend to be fuel-controlled and have exposed fuel surfaces.&nbsp; It is easy to make semi-stable and stable progress.&nbsp; Modest flow rates achieve surprisingly good results.</p>
	
	<p>Fires spreading through 
        <span class = "tooltip">large areas,<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >There is no sharp dividing line between room fires and large area fires.  We take 3,000 to 3,500 cubic feet to be transitional.</span></span></span>        
         as in many commercial occupancies, may feature a race between the firefighters’ rate of progress and the fire’s rate of spread.&nbsp; Higher flow rates and/or more reach may be required.</p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>During post-fire reviews, remember that FFs who hit flame without hitting the burning fuel surfaces might <strong>misread the problem as not enough GPM.</strong></p>
</section>
	
<section class="RQs"><h2>Questions</h2>
<!--	<h3>Why is there a minimum flow (GPM) required to make semi-stable progress in a typical room fire?</h3>
	<p>Some water will turn to steam before it reaches a fuel surface and some will evaporate from the surfaces.&nbsp; You need each surface to stay wet for at least a few seconds.</p>
	
	
<h3>Required GPM is related to volume of fire.&nbsp; What is the link between volume of fire and progress stability?</h3>
	<p>Larger bodies of fire are better at continuing to radiate heat back to fuel surfaces.&nbsp; It takes a little more water to wet those surfaces for the few seconds necessary.</p>
-->
	
	<h3>How should people calculate the initial flow rates required to darken down room fires?</h3>
	<p>The Iowa formula (lwh/100) is based on testing and gives a reasonable estimate.&nbsp; In practice, it’s very easy to deliver a lot more water than you need.&nbsp; Don’t overthink it. </p>
	<p>If you can't resist overthinking, remember that you don't have to absorb all the heat being produced in the room.&nbsp; Those calculations are incorrect.&nbsp; The tipping point is when you can wet an area of burning fuel and the radiant feedback does not immediately reignite it.&nbsp; How big that area needs to be is what determines the <a href="GPM.html" target="new">GPM that you need</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Did the introduction of plastic products (starting in the 1950s) increase the initial GPM required to knock down well-involved room fires?</h3>
	<p>Not really. </p>
	<p>The fuels that might need more GPM are those that affect progress stability.&nbsp; Gasoline is an example.&nbsp; Gasoline continues to produce flammable vapors after water is applied because its flash point is much lower than the temperature of the water.&nbsp; Fire may be able to flash back over an area already doused.</p>
	<p>Though parts of the room with no gasoline will darken down as usual, you might initially need a little more water to start bringing stability to your progress.&nbsp; (The difference isn’t always noticeable because common flow rates are so much higher than minimums.)</p>
	
	<p>Plastics, in contrast, stop making fuel gases when wet.&nbsp; They readily allow semi-stable and stable progress—just like paper, wood, cloth, paint, etc.</p> 
	
	<p>It is worth noting that synthetics produce more airborne fuel 
			<span class = "tooltip">(AF)<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >In this context, airborne fuel includes pyrolosis gases and partially-burned fuels.&nbsp; See <a href="FlameLength.html#AFdef">Flame Length etc</a> for a more general discussion.</span></span></span> 
		and change radiative feedback by making more soot.&nbsp;  Both effects are significant 
            <span class = "tooltip">tactically,<span class="tooltipcontent"><span class="tooltiptext" >In addition to the effects detailed in <a href="FlameLength.html">Flame Length etc</a>, excess AF increases the probability of smoke explosions and other rapid intensifications, sometimes remote from the obvious fire.	</span></span></span>
       but have only a tiny effect on required initial flow.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Are “direct attack” and “indirect attack” useful terms?</h3>
	<p>The usefulness of these terms is limited by their varying definitions.&nbsp;  I learned it as: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>A “direct attack” kills the fire mostly by wetting burning fuel surfaces.&nbsp; This includes water that hits the ceiling before it wets some other surface.</li>
		<li>An “indirect attack” knocks the fire mostly by making steam that smothers the fire.&nbsp;  The production of fuel gases then tapers off as the fuel surfaces cool by transferring heat to the enviroment.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Using that definition, when is an indirect attack warranted?</h3>
	<p>In a few situations that combine:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>access difficulty or some other reason to avoid a direct attack</li>
	<li>enough confinement to hold the steam while the fuels cool</li>
	<li>high levels of FF skill and coordination.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(FFs should be ready for sudden changes during an indirect attack.&nbsp; Progress may be unstable.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Wisdom">
  <p>Put water on the stuff that's burning.&nbsp; If the fire doesn't go out, it's probably because you didn't hit all the stuff.</p>
	<p>A building fire isn't out until the fuels are cool and the atmosphere is vented.
